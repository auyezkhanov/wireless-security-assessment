2.2 Vulnerability Identification
 1) KBTU
•	SSID Broadcast: Yes
•	Default Pattern: No
•	Encryption: WPA2-Enterprise (Strong)
•	Hidden: No
•	Duplicate SSIDs: Yes (12+ BSSIDs) — normal for campus Wi-Fi
Vulnerabilities:
•	Clients may be vulnerable to Evil Twin if they do not validate RADIUS certificates.
•	Possible KRACK (WPA2 vulnerabilities) depending on AP patch level.
•	Dense channel congestion → possible DoS susceptibility.

 2) Beeline_1C77
•	SSID Broadcast: Yes
•	Default Pattern: Yes (ISP-issued SSID)
•	Encryption: WPA2-Personal
•	Vulnerabilities:
o	ISP routers often use weak or predictable passwords
o	Susceptible to handshake capture → offline cracking
o	Exposure to deauthentication attacks

3) DIRECT-xx-HP Printer Networks (All WPA2-PSK)
These all share the same vulnerability profile:
Common Characteristics:
•	SSID Broadcast: Yes
•	Default Pattern: Yes (DIRECT-xxxxxxxx)
•	Encryption: WPA2-Personal
•	Hidden: No
Vulnerabilities:
•	Default SSID indicates exact device model → helps attacker identify target
•	Wi-Fi Direct often uses factory default passwords
•	Printers may expose:
o	Unsecured web admin panels
o	AirPrint/WSD services
o	UPnP attack vectors
•	Vulnerable to:
o	Evil Twin attack
o	Handshake capture → PSK cracking
o	Printer exploitation (Module 08 mentions IoT device weaknesses)
Networks affected:
DIRECT-C2-HP, DIRECT-BA-HP, DIRECT-74-HP, DIRECT-D2-HP, DIRECT-A4-HP, DIRECT-3D-HP, DIRECT-C0-HP
